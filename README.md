## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔗 API Integration

The project uses mock data served by this API:

```
https://5d76bf96515d1a0014085cf9.mockapi.io/product
```

### 📜 Routing Structure

```
/
|-- index.html
|-- clothing.html
|-- accessories.html
|-- contentDetails.html
|-- cart.html
```

### 🗂️ JavaScript Modules

* **content.js** → renders clothing & accessories on homepage
* **cart.js** → renders items added to cart
* **contentDetails.js** → shows full details of a selected item
* **header/footer includes** → reused in all pages
